## File Systems in the Cloud (AWS SimuLearn)

Through the **AWS SimuLearn – File Systems in the Cloud** labs, I gained hands-on experience with cloud-based file storage solutions, exploring how persistent file systems can be used to support scalable and collaborative applications. These labs focused on understanding when and why to use file-based storage, and how it complements object and block storage in cloud environments.

I worked with **shared file systems** to manage data that requires concurrent access across multiple cloud instances. This included configuring file system mounts, managing permissions, and understanding how these systems provide persistent, high-performance storage for applications with shared data needs.

The labs emphasized practical management techniques such as monitoring file system performance, configuring backups, and implementing security controls to protect sensitive data. I also learned how file systems integrate with other cloud services, supporting workloads like content management systems, collaborative applications, and lift-and-shift migrations.

Additionally, I developed an understanding of **storage evaluation**, considering factors such as access patterns, durability, availability, performance, and cost. This enabled me to select appropriate storage solutions based on application requirements and business objectives.

Overall, the **File Systems in the Cloud** module strengthened my ability to design and manage cloud storage solutions effectively, enhancing my skills in cloud engineering, backend development, and building scalable, data-driven applications.
