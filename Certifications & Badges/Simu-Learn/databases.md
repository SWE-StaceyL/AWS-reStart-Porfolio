## Databases (SimuLearn)

Through the **SimuLearn – Databases in Practice** labs, I explored core relational database concepts and gained hands-on experience working with structured data in realistic, scenario-based environments. These exercises focused on understanding how databases are designed, managed, and queried to support real-world applications and business requirements.

I worked extensively with **relational databases**, creating and managing tables, defining relationships, and applying constraints to maintain data integrity. Using **SQL**, I performed data definition and data manipulation tasks, including inserting, updating, and deleting records, as well as retrieving meaningful insights from data through structured queries.

The labs also emphasized practical querying techniques, such as filtering data with `WHERE` clauses, combining datasets using `JOIN` operations, and applying aggregate functions to analyze results. This strengthened my ability to write efficient, readable queries while understanding how database design impacts performance and scalability.

In addition, I developed an understanding of **database design fundamentals**, including normalization, relationships, and the importance of consistency and accuracy in data-driven systems. I learned how to evaluate database requirements by considering factors such as data structure, access patterns, integrity, and performance—skills that are essential for backend development and database-driven applications.

Overall, these labs reinforced best practices for working with databases in software and cloud environments, building a strong foundation for backend systems, APIs, and scalable, data-centric solutions.
