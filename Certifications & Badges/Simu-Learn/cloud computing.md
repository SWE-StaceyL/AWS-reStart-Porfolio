## Cloud Computing Essentials (AWS SimuLearn)

Through the **AWS SimuLearn – Cloud Computing Essentials** labs, I gained a foundational understanding of cloud computing concepts and how cloud services are used to build, deploy, and manage modern applications. These hands-on simulations focused on introducing core cloud principles while demonstrating how cloud technology supports scalability, availability, security, and cost efficiency.

I explored essential cloud concepts such as **on-demand computing, elasticity, scalability, and the shared responsibility model**, developing a clear understanding of how cloud computing differs from traditional on-premises infrastructure. The labs provided practical exposure to cloud-based environments, reinforcing how resources can be provisioned, managed, and adjusted dynamically based on workload demands.

Throughout the simulations, I worked with core AWS services and learned how cloud architecture supports high availability and fault tolerance. I gained insight into how compute, storage, and networking components work together within the cloud to deliver reliable and scalable solutions for applications and business systems.

Additionally, I learned how to evaluate cloud solutions by considering key factors such as **performance, security, availability, and cost**, enabling informed decision-making when designing cloud-based architectures. These labs reinforced AWS best practices for building efficient, secure, and scalable cloud environments.

Overall, this learning module strengthened my understanding of cloud fundamentals and provided a solid foundation for advancing into cloud engineering, backend development, and cloud-native application design.
