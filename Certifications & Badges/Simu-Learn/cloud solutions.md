## Computing Solutions (AWS SimuLearn)

Through the **AWS SimuLearn – Computing Solutions** labs, I gained hands-on experience with cloud-based compute services and developed a practical understanding of how computing resources are selected, configured, and managed to support scalable and reliable applications. These simulations focused on aligning compute solutions with application requirements and operational needs.

I explored the fundamentals of cloud compute, including how virtual servers and managed compute services are provisioned and scaled within AWS. The labs reinforced key concepts such as elasticity, high availability, and fault tolerance, demonstrating how compute resources can adapt dynamically to changing workloads.

Throughout the simulations, I learned how to evaluate compute options based on factors such as **performance, scalability, availability, and cost**. This included understanding when to use different compute models to support various use cases, from simple workloads to more complex, distributed applications.

The labs also emphasized operational best practices, including resource monitoring, cost awareness, and efficient workload management. I developed an appreciation for how compute services integrate with other cloud components such as storage and networking to form complete, resilient cloud architectures.

Overall, this module strengthened my understanding of cloud computing solutions and provided a strong foundation for building, deploying, and managing compute-driven applications in cloud and backend-focused environments.
