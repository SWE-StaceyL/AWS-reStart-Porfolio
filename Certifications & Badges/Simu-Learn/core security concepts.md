# AWS Security Concepts Lab

The AWS Security Concepts Lab provided hands-on experience in implementing foundational cloud security principles within the Amazon Web Services environment, with a strong focus on access control and identity management using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). The primary objective of the lab was to apply the principle of least privilege by configuring role-based access through IAM groups rather than assigning permissions directly to individual users. In this scenario, the SupportEngineers group was granted the AWS managed policies EC2ReadOnlyAccess and RDSReadOnlyAccess, allowing team members to securely view resources within Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) without the ability to modify, create, or delete infrastructure. This reinforced key security concepts including the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, centralized permission management, and scalable access governance through group-based policy attachment. The lab simulated a real-world enterprise use case in which a support team requires visibility into cloud resources for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes while maintaining strict controls to protect production environments. Through this exercise, I strengthened my understanding of IAM policy management, AWS managed policies, secure configuration practices, and governance strategies aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, further developing practical cloud security skills applicable to cloud engineering, DevOps, and security-focused roles.
