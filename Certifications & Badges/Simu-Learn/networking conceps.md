Networking Concepts (AWS SimuLearn)

Through the AWS SimuLearn – Networking Concepts labs, I gained hands-on experience with foundational cloud networking principles, exploring how networks are designed, managed, and secured in cloud environments. These labs focused on understanding the role of networking in supporting scalable, reliable, and high-performance cloud applications.

I worked with Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, and routing to design network architectures that isolate resources while enabling secure communication. This included configuring security groups, network ACLs, and route tables, as well as understanding how these components control traffic flow and enforce network security.

The labs emphasized practical techniques such as monitoring network traffic, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and implementing best practices for securing cloud networks. I also learned how networking integrates with other cloud services, supporting workloads like web applications, databases, and multi-tier architectures.

Additionally, I developed an understanding of network evaluation, considering factors such as latency, throughput, availability, redundancy, and cost. This enabled me to design network solutions that meet application requirements and business objectives effectively.

Overall, the Networking Concepts module strengthened my ability to design, implement, and manage cloud networks efficiently, enhancing my skills in cloud engineering, secure architecture design, and building scalable, connected applications.
