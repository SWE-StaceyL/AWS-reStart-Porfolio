## Cloud First Steps (AWS SimuLearn)

Through the **AWS SimuLearn – Cloud First Steps** labs, I gained an introductory, hands-on understanding of how cloud services are accessed, managed, and used within the AWS environment. These simulations focused on building initial familiarity with cloud concepts, the AWS Management Console, and the foundational services that support cloud-based solutions.

I explored the basics of navigating the AWS console, understanding regions and availability zones, and identifying core cloud services used to support applications and infrastructure. The labs helped me understand how cloud resources are provisioned and managed, reinforcing the concept of on-demand access and the flexibility of cloud computing.

The simulations also introduced key cloud principles such as **shared responsibility, security awareness, and cost considerations**, highlighting the importance of building responsibly in the cloud from the very beginning. I learned how to approach cloud environments with an understanding of governance, security best practices, and efficient resource usage.

Additionally, I developed an awareness of how cloud services work together to form complete solutions, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration into compute, storage, networking, and security services. These labs provided a smooth transition into more advanced cloud learning and hands-on technical modules.

Overall, the **Cloud First Steps** module established a strong foundation for continued learning in cloud computing, supporting my progression into cloud engineering, backend development, and cloud-native technologies.
