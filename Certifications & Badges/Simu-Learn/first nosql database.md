## First NoSQL Database (AWS SimuLearn)

Through the **AWS SimuLearn – First NoSQL Database** labs, I gained hands-on experience with non-relational database concepts and learned how NoSQL databases differ from traditional relational systems. These exercises focused on understanding when and why to use NoSQL solutions, and how they support modern, scalable, and flexible applications.

I worked with **Amazon DynamoDB**, a fully managed NoSQL database service, to store and manage structured and semi-structured data. This included creating tables, defining primary keys, inserting and retrieving items, and understanding partitioning and indexing to optimize performance.

The labs emphasized practical operations, such as querying and scanning data, handling high-volume transactions, and applying best practices for data modeling in NoSQL environments. I also explored how NoSQL databases support scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance, which are critical for applications that require flexible and dynamic data structures.

Additionally, I learned how to evaluate database solutions by considering factors such as data access patterns, consistency requirements, and throughput capacity. This reinforced my ability to select the most suitable database type—relational or NoSQL—based on application and business needs.

Overall, the **First NoSQL Database** module strengthened my understanding of modern data storage solutions and provided practical skills for building scalable, cloud-native applications, complementing my backend and cloud engineering knowledge.
