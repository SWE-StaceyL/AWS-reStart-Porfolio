Storage (AWS SimuLearn)

Through AWS SimuLearn labs, I explored multiple cloud storage options and developed a clear understanding of when and why to use each storage type based on application and business requirements. These labs focused on selecting, configuring, and managing storage solutions to ensure scalability, performance, security, and cost efficiency.

I worked with Amazon S3 (object storage) to store and manage unstructured data such as application assets, backups, and logs. This included configuring bucket policies, managing access permissions, enabling versioning, and applying lifecycle rules to transition data between storage classes for cost optimization.

I also explored file-based storage solutions, gaining hands-on experience with shared file systems designed for applications that require concurrent access and persistent storage. This helped me understand how file systems differ from object storage and when they are best suited for workloads such as content management systems, shared application data, and lift-and-shift migrations.

Additionally, I learned how to evaluate storage requirements by considering factors such as data access patterns, durability, availability, performance, and cost, allowing me to select the most appropriate storage solution for different use cases. These labs reinforced AWS best practices for secure storage, data protection, and long-term data management.
