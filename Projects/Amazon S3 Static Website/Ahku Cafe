# Ahku Café – Cloud Migration Project

## Project Overview
Ahku Café is a fictional lifestyle café focused on calm coffee rituals and mindful living.  
This project demonstrates the migration of Ahku Café’s outdated, on-premises web presence to a **fully cloud-based solution using Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

The goal of the migration is to improve availability, scalability, security, and cost efficiency while establishing a modern online presence.

Ahku Café previously relied on traditional, non-scalable infrastructure and had no reliable online platform to showcase its menu or engage customers.

Key challenges included:
- No online presence
- Limited customer reach
- High maintenance costs
