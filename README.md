Hi, I am Stacey L

### Introduction

I am a self-taught software engineer and an aspiring AWS Cloud Practitioner currently participating in the **Praesignis AWS re/Start cohort program. 
This repository documents my learning journey, furthermore developing hands-on skills through building, programming and security. I am furthering my career in cloud in order to persue a role in Cloud-Security, and reflections as I build practical cloud skills and work toward becoming a certified AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.

 The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **real-world cloud knowledge**, consistent learning, and applied problem-solving using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

 ### About the AWS re/Start Program

* Preparation for AWS certification

Through this cohort, I am gaining both **technical expertise** and **industry-ready skills** needed to succeed in the cloud ecosystem.

### AWS re/Start Journey – Praesignis Cohort

I joined the Praesignis-Cohort to gain cloud knowledge and experience. By gaining  AWS exposure throuth the cohort, I am able to build cloud computing foundations, apply AWS services and as well as gain practical knowledge through projects and labs. This cohort has assisted my confidence in obtaining a solid career in Cloud Computing and in IT.

### Cloud Practitioner Journey

My Cloud Practitioner journey focuses on building a strong foundation in AWS concepts, services, security, and pricing models. This aligns with the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam objectives.

### Core Areas of Focus:

* ☁️ **Cloud Concepts** – Benefits of cloud computing, deployment models, and global infrastructure
* 🔐 **Security & Compliance** – Shared Responsibility Model, IAM, security best practices
* 🧱 **Core AWS Services** – EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch
* 💰 **Pricing & Billing** – AWS Pricing Calculator, Cost Explorer, budgets, and support plans
* ⚙️ **Architecture Principles** – High availability, scalability, fault tolerance

### Skills & Technologies

Throughout the program, I am actively developing experience in:

* **Amazon EC2** (Linux & Windows instances)
* **Amazon S3** (storage, permissions, lifecycle policies)
* **IAM** (users, roles, policies, security best practices)
* **VPC & Networking Basics**
* **CloudWatch & Monitoring**
* **AWS Pricing & Cost Management Tools**
* **Infrastructure concepts (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)**

Complementary skills include:

* Git & GitHub
* Basic Linux commands
* Technical documentation
* Problem-solving and troubleshooting

### Objectives

* ✅ Build a solid foundation in AWS Cloud concepts
* ✅ Complete hands-on labs and real-world scenarios
* ✅ Prepare for and pass the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam
* ✅ Showcase cloud knowledge through documented projects
* ✅ Transition into a **cloud-focused role** (Cloud Support / Cloud Engineer / Cloud Practitioner)

### Continuous Learning

This repository will be **regularly updated** as I progress through the program. Expect to see:

* New labs and projects
* Improved documentation
