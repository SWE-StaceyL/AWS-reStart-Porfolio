* 🧱 **Core AWS Services** – EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch
* 💰 **Pricing & Billing** – AWS Pricing Calculator, Cost Explorer, budgets, and support plans
* ⚙️ **Architecture Principles** – High availability, scalability, fault tolerance

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

Throughout the program, I am actively developing experience in:

* **Amazon EC2** (Linux & Windows instances)
* **Amazon S3** (storage, permissions, lifecycle policies)
* **IAM** (users, roles, policies, security best practices)
* **VPC & Networking Basics**
* **CloudWatch & Monitoring**
* **AWS Pricing & Cost Management Tools**
* **Infrastructure concepts (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)**

Complementary skills include:

* Git & GitHub
